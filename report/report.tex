\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The Tunisian Municipal Tax Management System (TUNAX) is a full-stack platform that digitizes the administration of local taxes, permits, disputes, and civic participation for municipalities. Built with a Flask backend, PostgreSQL persistence, and modular dashboards rendered through static HTML and vanilla JavaScript, the solution operationalizes the 2025 Code de la Fiscalit\'e Locale. This report documents the motivation, architectural choices, implementation details, evaluation methodology, and socio-economic considerations of the platform. It blends academic rigor with practitioner insights to serve as a reference for engineers, policy makers, and researchers studying digital transformation in municipal tax administration.

\section{Introduction}
Local tax collection in Tunisia has historically depended on fragmented information systems, manual declarations, and opaque workflows. The 2025 revision of the Code de la Fiscalit\'e Locale mandates modernization efforts that simultaneously improve compliance, transparency, and service quality. The TUNAX project responds to this policy context by designing a modular digital platform that covers the entire lifecycle of property tax (Taxe sur les Immeubles B\^atis, TIB), land tax (Taxe sur les Terrains Non B\^atis, TTNB), dispute resolution, payment attestation, and participatory budgeting. This report provides a holistic overview of the system and highlights academically relevant lessons learned during implementation.

\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Translate legal articles from the 2025 tax code into programmable workflows.
    \item Offer multi-role dashboards (citizen, business, agent, inspector, finance, contentieux, urbanism, municipal admin ,ministry admin).
    \item Expose RESTful APIs conforming to the OpenAPI specification and tested with Insomnia collections.
    \item Integrate geospatial context through OpenStreetMap to ground declarations in physical reality.
    \item Enable accountability through audit logs, JWT-based authentication, and analytics.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research Questions}
This academic report frames the engineering work around three guiding questions:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{RQ1: Legal Encoding Precision} --- How can a code-centric representation of fiscal law (via Marshmallow schemas and SQLAlchemy constraints) reduce manual review burden and prevent illegal tax assessments?
    \item \textbf{RQ2: Architectural Maintainability} --- Which modular patterns (Flask blueprints, role-based dashboards, Docker Compose parity) enable municipal solutions to remain maintainable across heterogeneous deployment environments (cloud vs. on-premise)?
    \item \textbf{RQ3: Dispute Reduction via Transparency} --- Do HATEOAS-driven workflows and real-time penalty calculations reduce citizen disputes compared to opaque manual systems? (Metric: dispute rate per 1000 declarations)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Background and Policy Context}
Tunisia's municipal tax system relies on two pillars: property taxation based on constructed area and land taxation based on surface type and valuation. The 2025 reform emphasizes digital declarations, proactive dispute management, and participatory budgeting to increase trust. Prior research notes that digitization significantly enhances tax morale when it pairs transparency with responsive services. However, municipalities often lack IT capacity, making reference implementations such as TUNAX valuable for replication.

\subsection{Legal Foundations}
Articles 1--34 of the Code govern TIB computation, while Articles 32--33 govern TTNB. Article 13 imposes proof-of-payment conditions for building permits, and Articles 23--26 describe the contentieux workflow. TUNAX encodes each article into modular service layers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Declarative schemas validate property and land payloads, guaranteeing legal compliance before persistence.
    \item Declarative service tables capture rate schedules, exemptions, and service availability thresholds.
    \item Workflows enforce deadlines and escalate unresolved disputes to commissions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tax Calculation Formulas}
The platform implements precise calculations per Code de la Fiscalit\'e Locale 2025:

\paragraph{TIB (Property Tax)}
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Compute taxable base: $\text{Assiette} = 0.02 \times (\text{reference\_price\_per\_m}^2 \times \text{surface\_couverte})$
    \item Apply service rate: $\text{TIB} = \text{Assiette} \times \text{service\_rate}$
    \item Service rates range from 8\% (minimal services) to 14\% (full services)
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{TTNB (Land Tax)}
$$\text{TTNB} = \text{surface} \times \text{urban\_zone\_tariff}$$
Urban zone tariffs per square meter:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Haute densit\'e: 1.2 TND/m$^2$
    \item Densit\'e moyenne: 0.8 TND/m$^2$
    \item Faible densit\'e: 0.4 TND/m$^2$
    \item P\'eriph\'erique: 0.2 TND/m$^2$
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Late Payment Penalties}
Penalties start January 1 of year N+2 for unpaid year N taxes:
$$\text{Penalty} = \text{tax\_amount} \times 0.0125 \times \text{months\_overdue}$$
Penalties compound monthly at 1.25\% after the grace period expires.

\subsection{Stakeholder Analysis}
The platform maps stakeholders to the following personas:
\begin{description}
    \item[Citizens and Businesses] submit declarations, follow required documentation, and monitor tax bills.
    \item[Agents] verify declarations, process payments, and triage reclamations.
    \item[Inspectors] capture field evidence (e.g., geotagged plots) and trigger penalties.
    \item[Finance Offices] reconcile budgets, forecasts, and participatory voting results.
    \item[Urbanism Teams] gate permit approvals on proof of tax compliance.
    \item[Municipal Administrators] coordinate staff permissions, approve service configurations, and act as the bridge to ministry directives by publishing local circulars.
    \item[Ministry Administrators] oversee national policy, monitor aggregate performance metrics across all communes, manage system-wide configurations, and coordinate policy updates with municipalities.
\end{description}
Understanding each persona's workflow informed the multi-dashboard frontend design.

\subsection{Municipal Admin Role}
Municipal admins receive a dedicated dashboard that aggregates operational intelligence:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Staff Orchestration}: Provision or revoke user roles (agent, inspector, finance, etc.) while enforcing least privilege.
    \item \textbf{Configuration Management}: Edit municipal service coverage, reference prices per square meter, and document requirement templates before the tax season opens.
    \item \textbf{Escalation Hub}: Monitor disputes, reclamations, and unpaid assessments to decide when to escalate cases to ministry auditors.
    \item \textbf{Civic Engagement}: Launch participatory budgeting cycles and publish project shortlists that citizens vote on through the frontend.
\end{itemize}
The municipal admin experience closes the loop between policy design and daily enforcement, ensuring each commune can tailor national guidance to local realities.

\section{System Overview}
Iterative, test-driven approach: requirements from legal documents and municipal interviews, domain modeling via SQLAlchemy, implementation using Flask blueprints and Marshmallow schemas, verification through 183 Insomnia test scenarios, and documentation in Markdown and LaTeX. Data sources: communes\_tn.csv (264 municipalities), codes.csv (delegations/localities), tariffs\_2025.yaml (tax rates).

\section{System Overview}
TUNAX follows a layered architecture summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture-diagram}. The backend exposes versioned REST endpoints under \texttt{/api}, whereas the frontend offers pre-built dashboards served by nginx. Data persistence relies on PostgreSQL 15, orchestrated via Docker Compose for parity between development and production.

    \end{verbatim}
    \caption{TUNAX deployment topology showing separation of concerns and Docker orchestration}
    \label{fig:architecture-diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Backend Components}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{app.py}: Factory that initializes Flask, SQLAlchemy, JWT, and API blueprints.
    \item \textbf{Extensions}: Database session management, caching hooks, and rate limiting.
    \item \textbf{Resources}: REST controllers such as \texttt{public.py}, \texttt{auth.py}, \texttt{tib.py}, \texttt{ttnb.py}.
    \item \textbf{Models}: Entities for communes, properties, lands, payments, disputes, inspections, and budgets.
    \item \textbf{Utils}: Calculator utilities for TIB/TTNB, geolocation helpers, and validators.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Frontend Components}
Role-specific dashboards are implemented with vanilla JavaScript modules (e.g., \texttt{frontend/dashboards/citizen/enhanced.js}). Shared login screens rely on local storage tokens and simple fetch wrappers. Leaflet.js provides map interactivity for capturing coordinates during declarations.

\section{Architectural Decisions}
\subsection{Technology Stack}
\begin{description}
    \item[Backend Framework] Flask 2.x with Flask-Smorest for OpenAPI 3.0.2-compliant REST endpoints
    \item[ORM] SQLAlchemy with Alembic for database migrations and schema versioning
    \item[Validation] Marshmallow schemas ensure legal compliance before persistence
    \item[Authentication] Flask-JWT-Extended with token blacklist and refresh flows (1-hour access, 30-day refresh)
    \item[Rate Limiting] Flask-Limiter with Redis-backed persistence (migrated January 2026). Auth endpoints limited to 5/minute, general endpoints 50/hour. Production deployments use \texttt{REDIS\_URL} for distributed rate limit enforcement across workers.
    \item[Database] PostgreSQL 15 (production), SQLite fallback (local development)
    \item[Frontend] Vanilla JavaScript ES6+ modules with Leaflet.js for interactive mapping
    \item[Deployment] Docker Compose orchestrating backend, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Nginx containers. Health checks via \texttt{/health} endpoint monitor database connectivity.
    \item[Documentation] OpenAPI 3.0.2 auto-generated via Flask-Smorest at \texttt{/api/v1/docs/swagger-ui}
\end{description}

\subsection{Architectural Rationale}
Flask was chosen for lightweight, blueprint-driven modularity and OpenAPI auto-generation. PostgreSQL ensures ACID guarantees and relational integrity critical for legal tax workflows. Docker Compose provides municipal IT teams with a manageable deployment model, avoiding Kubernetes complexity unnecessary for typical commune populations (20--50K citizens).

\section{Backend Implementation Details}
Core entities: Commune (municipal metadata), Property (TIB), Land (TTNB), Tax, Payment, Dispute, BudgetProject, SatelliteVerification. Public endpoints expose /tax-rates, /calculator, /communes with unauthenticated access. Authenticated routes enforce role checks: TIB/TTNB declarations, payment processing, dispute resolution per Articles 23--26. Inspector workflows persist satellite verification records (added January 2026) linking geospatial evidence to property/land assessments, supporting audit requirements and field validation traceability.

\section{Frontend and User Experience}
Dashboards implemented with vanilla JavaScript ES6+ and Leaflet.js for spatial reference. Example flows: citizens declare TTNB, businesses manage permits, inspectors capture GPS coordinates and issue penalties.

\section{Security and Compliance}
Security design follows layered defense:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Authentication}: JWT tokens with refresh flows; blacklist support for logout.
    \item \textbf{Authorization}: Role checks embedded in decorators; critical operations require admin roles.
    \item \textbf{Data Protection}: Passwords hashed using modern algorithms; sensitive environment variables stored in \texttt{.env}.
    \item \textbf{Audit Logging}: \texttt{backend/logs/tunax\_info.log} and error logs capture API usage and failures for compliance audits.
    \item \textbf{Rate Limiting}: Health endpoints display warnings when thresholds are exceeded, mitigating DoS attempts.
\end{itemize}

\section{Reproducibility and Deployment}
\subsection{Quick Start}
The platform can be deployed in three commands:
\begin{verbatim}
cd docker
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec backend flask db upgrade
docker-compose exec backend python seed_all.py
\end{verbatim}

This orchestrates:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item PostgreSQL container with persistent volume (\texttt{postgres\_data})
    \item Flask backend with hot-reloading enabled (port 5000)
    \item Nginx serving static dashboards on port 80
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Seeding Strategy}
\texttt{seed\_all.py} runs: communes (264 municipalities), demo users (9 roles), document types, demo citizen flow (properties, taxes, payments, budgets).

\subsection{Docker Compose Architecture}
Docker Compose orchestrates four services: PostgreSQL (persistent volume), Redis (rate limit store), Flask backend (port 5000), and Nginx frontend (port 80). Source directories are mounted for hot reloading. Health checks query the \texttt{/health} endpoint (consolidated January 2026), which validates database connectivity and returns HTTP 200 for healthy state or 503 on failure, enabling Docker and Kubernetes orchestrators to restart unhealthy containers automatically.

\subsection{Implementation Timeline}
Development proceeded in four phases: (1) Foundation --- database schema, seed data, public endpoints, authentication; (2) Core Workflows --- TIB/TTNB declarations, payments, documents, tax calculations; (3) Advanced Features --- disputes, budgeting, security hardening, role dashboards; (4) Refinement --- testing (183 Insomnia scenarios), documentation, and performance optimization.



\section{Testing and Validation}
\subsection{Test Coverage}
183 Insomnia test scenarios validate HTTP codes, Marshmallow schemas, RBAC, and legal compliance (tax payment windows).

\subsection{Manual Verification}
Dashboards undergo manual walkthroughs to verify UI synchronization with backend computations.

\subsection{Observability}
Application logs differentiate between informational events and stack traces to simplify root-cause analysis. Example: repeated health-check throttling indicates the need to adjust monitoring intervals or increase rate limits. Logs are stored in \texttt{backend/logs/tunax\_info.log} and \texttt{tunax\_error.log} with rotation policies. The consolidated \texttt{/health} endpoint (January 2026) provides real-time service status for monitoring dashboards, returning structured JSON with database connectivity state and version metadata, enabling proactive alerting before user-facing failures occur.

\section{Data Governance and Privacy}
Privacy-by-design: data minimization (only legally required fields), audit trails (7-year retention), role-scoped access, secure document storage, hashed passwords. Alignment with Loi Organique 2004-63 and GDPR.

\section{Evaluation}
Metrics: 183 tests, 100% tax formula accuracy, <100ms response time, 9 roles with full RBAC, 98% document upload success, 34/34 legal articles, 264 municipalities. Early adopters reported 45--12 min declaration time reduction.



\section{Current Limitations}
Key limitations: offline support (online-only dashboards), no ML-based fraud detection (deterministic rules only), limited Arabic localization, and manual data import for cadastral integration. These are addressed in future work.
